# Introduction to UNIT Projects begins here!
Those projects are general, they standed for getting the basics of C programming language <br />
1. Piscine Reloaded refreshed the knowledges, that I got from Piscine C, the enrollment stage in Unit.
2. Once we aren't allowed to use C standard libraries for our further projects, I had to write my own library called Libft for that.
3. Get_Next_Line Project brought to me understanding about file descriptors, structures in C, chained lists, etc.
4. Fillit was the first project, where we had to create our algorithm, based on Backtracking.
